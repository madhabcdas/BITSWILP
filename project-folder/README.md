**Preparing markdown for README.md**

The user wants code for a README.md, which likely means markdown content. They provided blank tables, but the assignment requires specific headers. I'll make sure to correct that and provide the proper headers. I'll format everything as a single code block, no extra chatter. Just focusing on getting the markdown right with the correct table headers as per the assignment.

# Breast Cancer Classification – Machine Learning Model Evaluation

## a. Problem Statement

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates.  
This project focuses on building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to classify tumors as **Benign (B)** or **Malignant (M)** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.  
The goal is to compare six ML models based on standard evaluation metrics and identify which model performs best for this classification task.

## b. Dataset Description

The dataset contains **30 numerical features** computed from digitized images of breast mass cell nuclei.  
These features describe characteristics such as:

- Radius  
- Texture  
- Perimeter  
- Area  
- Smoothness  
- Compactness  
- Concavity  
- Symmetry  
- Fractal dimension  

Each feature is provided in three forms:

- Mean  
- Standard error (SE)  
- Worst (largest value)  

The target variable is:

- **Diagnosis**
  - **B = Benign (0)**
  - **M = Malignant (1)**  

The dataset used for evaluation is uploaded by the user through the Streamlit interface.

## c. Models Used

The following six machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- k‑Nearest Neighbour (kNN)  
- Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)  
- Random Forest (Ensemble)  
- XGBoost (Ensemble)  

Evaluation metrics computed for each model:

- Accuracy  
- AUC  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient)
